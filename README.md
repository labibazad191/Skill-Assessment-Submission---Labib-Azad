- Opens in default browser at http://localhost:4200

- Uses in-memory-web-api as a mock backend

# Build for Production
- ng build --prod

# Technical Details

- Framework: Angular 15+

- Language: TypeScript

- State Management: NgRx (optional) / Service-based state

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- Backend Simulation: angular-in-memory-web-api

- All data is currently stored in memory (mock API).

- Event duplication is prevented via form validation.

- Real-time updates are simulated; no actual backend server is required.
